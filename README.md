# neural-networks-and-deep-learning-Python-3
Code from Michael Nielsen's book neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com adapted to Python 3.8. <br />
Added sevaral comments and some more multi-class evaluation metrics. <br />
The original code repo can be found here: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning <br />
 
You can run the demo program (train and evaluate NN) simply by executing:

MNIST Digits classification
> python run_network_mnist.py

Binary classification
> python run_network_binary_classification.py
